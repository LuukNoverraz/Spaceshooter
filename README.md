# Spaceshooter
A Space Shooter game I recreated for the Unity-1 module.

This game was made via following the official "Space Shooter" Unity tutorial.
However, there are some things I've changed (besides from having to convert the outdated code).
These things include:
* Custom title screen
* Receiving a penalty to your score when letting asteroids go off the screen
* Two bolts can now collide, when they do a custom smaller explosion will go off
* UI changes (include font and color)
* WASD/Space controls have been added alongside mouse controls
* There is a secret first person mode accesible by pressing F1. To return to third person, press F3
* Slight audio tweaks
